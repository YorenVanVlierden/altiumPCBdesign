#### nixie clock
The NIXIE tube was originally developed in 1952 by the Haydu brothers for the Burroughs company as a precursor to the computer monitor. The experimental name "Numerical Indicator Experimental: NIX-i" was first a working name belonging to the Burroughs company but later became the common name for this readout.

From the early 1950s through the 1970s, these Nixie tubes served as the dominant display. Later they were supplanted by LED displays and are quite rare these days!

They found their way into test equipment, early computers, aerospace, undersea and showing the stock prices on the New York stock exchange. While LEDs are technically more advanced, their aesthetic appearance leaves much to be desired.

#### How does it work?
The digits of a Nixie consist of ten thin metal electrodes that are individually shaped and can take on uneven curves and oblique lines. The only technical flaw is based on the fact that the numbers are stacked for each other; this causes tiny gaps. Ironically, they were hardly used as clock displays. Their popularity has declined dramatically in recent years. Today their historical value is greatly increased. In essence, they are like miniature neon signs with a warm, comforting orange/violet glow. Nixie clocks have become very popular as a way to bring these devices out of the dark.

Each glass tube contains 10 or more individual cathode wires in the form of numbers or letters. The cathodes are stacked so that the different figures at different depths, unlike a plane display, appear in the same plane to the viewer. The anode is a transparent metal mesh that wraps around the front of the tube.

The tube is filled with the inert neon gas (and other gases) with a small amount of mercury. When a DC voltage of 120 to 180 volts is applied between the anode and any cathode, the gas will settle on the closest cathode and the figure will emit a beautiful glow.
